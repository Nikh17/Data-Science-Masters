    "Q1)What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that uses JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. It is designed to store and manage large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, making it a flexible and scalable option for modern web and mobile applications. Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional table-based schema of relational databases like SQL. Instead, they store data in various formats such as documents, graphs, or key-value pairs. Non-relational databases are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data and are often used for applications that require high performance, scalability, and flexibility. MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility is required: MongoDB allows developers to change the database schema without needing to perform a migration or rebuild the entire database, making it more flexible than SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling: MongoDB can scale horizontally across multiple servers, making it a good choice for applications that require high scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance: MongoDB is designed to handle large volumes of data and can perform read and write operations faster than SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex data: MongoDB supports complex data types like arrays, nested documents, and geospatial data, making it ideal for applications that require complex data modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time data processing: MongoDB can support real-time processing of data, such as for use in IoT or streaming applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2.state and Explain the features of MongoDB?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that has gained popularity among developers for its flexibility, scalability, and performance. Here are some of the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "a)Dynamic schema: MongoDB uses a dynamic schema, which means that documents in a collection can have different fields and data types. This flexibility allows for easy and fast changes to the database structure, making it ideal for agile development.\n",
    "\n",
    "b)Document-oriented: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means that it stores data in documents rather than rows and tables. Each document can contain multiple fields and nested data structures, making it easy to store complex data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "c)High availability: MongoDB is designed to be highly available, with features like automatic failover and replica sets that ensure that data is always accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "d)Scalability: MongoDB can scale horizontally across multiple servers, allowing it to handle large volumes of data and traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "e)Querying and indexing: MongoDB supports complex queries and indexing, making it easy to find and retrieve specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "f)Aggregation framework: MongoDB includes a powerful aggregation framework that allows developers to perform complex data processing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "g)Geospatial data support: MongoDB includes built-in support for geospatial data types and queries, making it easy to work with location-based data.\n",
    "\n",
    "h)Full-text search: MongoDB supports full-text search, allowing developers to search for data across multiple fields in a collection."
